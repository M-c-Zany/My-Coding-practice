Simplified Selenium WebDriver architecture:
1. After triggering the test, the complete Selenium code (Client), which we have written, will be converted to JSON format.
2. The generated JSON is sent to the Browser driver (Server) through the HTTP protocol. 
   Note: Each browser communicates with its respective browser driver and executes the commands.
3. Browser drivers communicate with their respective browsers and execute the commands by interpreting the received JSON on the browser.
4. The Browser Driver receives responses back from the browser and sends JSON responses back to the client.
