// In programming, variables are containers that store data. They represent named memory locations used to hold values that can change during program execution. Simply put, a variable is like a labeled box where you can store different types of informationâ€”numbers, text, arrays, objects, etc.

$name = "dhana";
$age = 23;
$income = 200000000;
// Here we can give a float also in the PHP
// $income = 20.00;
// $namE = "Capital E variable dhana";

echo "$name is a very talented woman. She is only $age years old and earns $income per annum.<br>";
// If we want to give a break for lines, we can use the HTML br tag in the code to start the text on the next line.

// echo "$namE";
