two_digit_number = input()
# This line prompts the user to enter a two-digit number, and the input is stored as a string in the variabletwo_digit_number.

first_digit = two_digit_number[0] 
# This line extracts the first digit of the input number by indexing the stringtwo_digit_number. Strings in Python are zero-indexed, sotwo_digit_number[0] refers to the first character (digit) in the string.

second_digit = two_digit_number[1]
# Similarly, this line extracts the second digit of the input number using indexing.

result = int(first_digit) + int(second_digit)
# The extracted digits are then converted to integers using theint() function, and their sum is calculated. The result is stored in the variableresult.

print(result)
# Finally, the sum of the two digits is printed to the console.

# Here's an example of how the code works:
Input: 45
Output: 9


# In this example, the program extracts the digits '4' and '5', converts them to integers, adds them together (4 + 5), and prints the result, which is 9.
